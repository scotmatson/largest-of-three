================

This is a simple application demonstrating some of the commonly used features of the Android environment, such as...

  - Passing Data between Activities
  
  - Using static fragments
  
  - Implementing Media ( just Audio at this time )
  
  - Receiving user data and acting upon it to produce a calculated output
  
  - Data persistence
  
This is strictly for educational purposes at this time but I invite you to expand upon the foundation that I've provided.
Please continue to branch this repository so others may benefit from your creative input. 

The graphics and layout do not seem to render well on most devices; this was strictly targetted towards N4 & N5 users as
this is the Android device I have been using for the past two years. No intentions to expand this application for additional
support are planned at this time.
